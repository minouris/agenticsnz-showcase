### Iris

![Iris](screenshots/iris.png)

Integrated Repository for Information & Systems — a web-based architectural modeling tool.

**Description:** Create, manage, and version architectural entities, relationships, and diagrams in a repository-first system where entities are the source of truth and diagrams are projections. Supports Simple View, UML, ArchiMate, and sequence diagrams with an interactive knowledge graph, collections and sets, audit logging, and full keyboard accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA).

**Stack:** SvelteKit, Svelte 5, @xyflow/svelte, Tailwind CSS v4, FastAPI, SQLite / Supabase (PostgreSQL), Argon2id + JWT auth

### Guild Hall

![Guild Hall](screenshots/guild-hall.png)

A quest-based engagement platform that reframes community participation around adventure rather than obligation.

**Description:** Game Masters design quests with objectives, deadlines, and difficulty levels. Community members accept quests from a Bounty Board, submit evidence to complete objectives, and earn points and skill tier progression. Built on the philosophy that "obstacles are expected" on quests, whereas goals frame struggle as failure.

**Stack:** Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Supabase, TanStack Query, React Hook Form, Zod, Vitest, Netlify

### Matariki Stellar Navigator

![Matariki Stellar Navigator](screenshots/matariki.png)

An interactive web experience celebrating Matariki, the Māori New Year.

**Description:** Explore the nine stars of the Matariki cluster through an interactive navigator that pairs traditional stories and cultural significance with a guided star-finding experience. Built with respect for Māori culture and traditions.

**Stack:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Netlify

**Builder:** [Chris Barlow](https://github.com/cgbarlow)

## Tools for AI Agent Development

Projects in this section are libraries, frameworks, and tooling that help *build* AI coding agents — not the agents themselves, but the infrastructure around them.

---

### Campaign Mode

![Campaign Mode](screenshots/campaign-mode.jpg)

Assemble a party of AI advisors with genuinely different perspectives.

**Description:** A plugin system for Claude Desktop and Claude Code CLI that frames collaborative problem-solving as a quest. Six animal-based agents provide distinct viewpoints while three NPC characters (Gandalf, Guardian, Dragon) offer mentorship, progress evaluation, and adversarial testing — helping surface blind spots and stress-test ideas before they matter. Built on the Six Animals framework with Markdown-based persistence for campaign state.

**Stack:** Claude Desktop / Claude Code plugin, Markdown persistence (`.campaign/quest.md`), CC-BY-SA-4.0

**Builder:** [Chris Barlow](https://github.com/cgbarlow)

### Machine Dream

A continuous AI cognition platform that lets models learn from experience and consolidate knowledge across sessions.

**Description:** Uses Sudoku as a research testbed to implement a learning loop where AI plays puzzles, makes mistakes, "dreams" (consolidates experiences into patterns), and improves over time — with no external hints or deterministic fallbacks. Implements the GRASP Loop (Generate → Review → Absorb → Synthesize → Persist) with three clustering algorithms: FastCluster, DeepCluster, and LLMCluster.

**Stack:** TypeScript, Node.js 20+, SQLite, OpenAI-compatible APIs (LM Studio, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter)

**Builder:** [Chris Barlow](https://github.com/cgbarlow)

### ADR (WH(Y) Method)

An enhanced Architecture Decision Record format for AI-assisted development teams.

**Description:** Addresses structural inconsistency and the conflation of decision rationale with implementation details in existing ADR practice. Provides standardised templates, dependency tracking between decisions, and governance metadata so humans and AI agents can capture and maintain architectural choices with clarity. Language-agnostic and designed to integrate with ADR tooling via options like `adr new --mode=enhanced`.

**Stack:** Markdown specification, language-agnostic templates
